## Phase 1 - Factor Screening
The objective of this phase is to determine whether all 3 factors i.e Tile Size, Preview Size and Preview Length are important in reducing the *Average Browsing Time* of the user. If there is any factor not significant to the response variable it can be removed from further analysis. 

After running a linear regression model, we observed that Tile Size did not have an effect on our response variable which can be seen in the factor screening plots. Therefore, we can omit that factor and only use Preview Size and Length to reach the optimal value.
